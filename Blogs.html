        Choosing Coding Blocks has been one of the best decisions of my life.
        <br>
        <br>
        I could easy realise this when I first had a talk with my mentor.Teaching methodology,assignments,hackathons,doubt resolutions,everthing was beyond compare.
        <br>
        <br>
        we were pushed to explore our limits and this show in success we achieve.
        <br>
        <br>
        A big to thanks to Coding Blocks and kartik mathur sir for everything.

        Coding Blocks is the best choice I made in my life.
        <br>
        <br>
        I always dreamt of making it to the tech bigwigs and after having the discussion with one of the mentor at coding blocks,I decided to move with them.
        <br>
        <br>
        Everyone here is so brilliant , passionate and focussed.
        <br>
        <br>
        Coding Blocks helped me in becoming an ace coder and then with mock coding rounds and experienced industry coaches tells us how to crack different companies.
        <br>
        <br>
        Wish Coding Blocks achieve all the success in future , Big thanks.

        My coding journey began after second year. Till then I had no clue how my future would look like.
        <br>
        <br>
        I joined CB just like any other student to get a decent placement after Bech, I wan't lie it was the need of the hour p and was bit skepital too.I didn't know that's what I wanted to do.but the more time I spent coding,talking to mentors,and discussing stuff with peers .I guess after that there was no turning back.
        <br>
        <br>
        I would like to thanks Coding Blocks for everything.
